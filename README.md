<summary>üîê Step 5: Open and Configure the Power BI Template</summary>

### What You'll Do
Connect the Power BI template to your data sources using Direct Query (Viva Insights) and file paths (CSV files).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the template**
   - Download **AI-in-One Dashboard - Template.pbit** from this repository

2. **Get Viva Insights connection parameters**
   - Go back to your Person Query in Viva Insights: [https://analysis.insights.viva.office.com/Analysis](https://analysis.insights.viva.office.com/Analysis)
   - Find your completed query in the list
   - Click the **link icon** in the row to copy the connection link
   
   ![Query row showing link icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/DecodingSuperUsage/refs/heads/DecodingSuperUsage/images/AnalysisResultsLink.png)

3. **Extract connection identifiers**
   - From the copied URL, extract:
     - **partitionId**: 36-character GUID (first ID in URL)
     - **queryId**: 36-character GUID (second ID in URL)
   - Confirm each is exactly 36 characters
   
   ![Partition and Query IDs highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/DecodingSuperUsage/refs/heads/DecodingSuperUsage/images/CopyIdentifiers.png)

4. **Open the template in Power BI Desktop**
   - Double-click the `.pbit` file
   - A parameter dialog will appear

5. **Enter connection parameters**
   - **partitionId**: Paste the 36-character partition ID
   - **queryId**: Paste the 36-character query ID
   - **Copilot Audit Log Path**: Full path to your audit log CSV  
     Example: `C:\Data\Copilot_Audit_Logs.csv`
   - **Licensed Users Path**: Full path to your licensed users CSV  
     Example: `C:\Data\Copilot_Licensed_Users.csv`
   - **Org Data Path**: Full path to your org data CSV  
     Example: `C:\Data\Org_Data_Entra.csv`

6. **Load the data**
   - Click **Load**
   - Wait for all queries to refresh (may take 5‚Äì15 minutes on first load)
   - If errors occur, verify file paths are correct and files are accessible

7. **Save and publish**
   - Save as a `.pbix` file (e.g., `AI-in-One Dashboard.pbix`)
   - Publish to your Power BI workspace
   - ‚úÖ **No scheduled refresh required** for Viva data (Direct Query auto-refreshes weekly if enabled)
   - Configure scheduled refresh for CSV files in Power BI Service (optional)

### Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: "File not found" error
  - **Solution**: Verify file paths use absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Data\file.csv`, not `.\file.csv`) and files exist at those locations

- **Issue**: "Could not connect to Viva Insights"
  - **Solution**: Verify partitionId and queryId are exactly 36 characters and copied correctly from the URL

- **Issue**: Data refresh takes extremely long
  - **Solution**: Check CSV file sizes. Very large audit logs (>500 MB) may need to be filtered or split.
